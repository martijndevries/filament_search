# filament_search
This notebook contains the code used to detect pulsar filaments in X-ray data, with an example image of PSR J2030+4415
. Pulsar filaments are typically faint, extended and narrow features that extend outwards from the pulsar. The code will calculate the counts in a box rotating around a central point (the pulsar).
The plot of angle vs number of counts can then be inspected to look for hints of more counts in a certain direction. <br>

The notebook assumes the Chandra software kit CIAO is installed.
